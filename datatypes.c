    //////////////////
    // Declarations //
    //////////////////

    /* Every variable must be declared, giving its type followed by its name. this might look like

        Pseudocode
    > type_name var_name;

        Example Code
    > int num_spaces;

    You can declare multiple variables of the same type by seperating them with commas like so

        Pseudocode
    > type_name var1, var2, var3;

        Example Code
    > int num_spaces, num_squares, player_count, total_score;

    additionally the variable can be initialized at the same time

        Pseudocode
    > type_name var_name = init_value;

        Example Code
    > int num_spaces = 10;

    When we do this, we reserve a section of memory for the variable, the occupied space is called
    an *object* or a *data object*. We use the variable name to access that object. The amount of
    memory allocated depends on the type.


    //////////////////
    // Types        //
    //////////////////

    Some built in types in C are
        * char - 1 byte integer used to store character information
        * int - 4 byte or 8 byte (depending on system) integer
        * float - floating point numbers of single precision
        * double - floating point numbers of double precision

    each of these can have qualifiers like long or unsigned that modify the kinds of values they
    can hold.
